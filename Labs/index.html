                        Welcome to Sunshine Kindergarten Institution! <br/>
                        "Sunshine Kindergarten" wants to create a fun and informative webpage for their classroom. 
                        This institution teaches the children the skills and knowledge that is needed in the future. 
                        The children will be guided throughout their studies to ensure that they succeed academically. 
                        All classes length is 50 minutes that would give the students time to take break or move between rooms. 
                        The children will learn new concepts from their teacher and will be asked to apply it by giving activity to work on. 
                        For those classes that have labs, the teacher can decide when to deliver lab sessions to the children. <br/>
                        It is suggested for the children to take minimum 4 classes and maximum 8 classes. 
                        It is suggested that the parents do the class registeration for children. <br/>
                        Take note that the children will have break from 10 AM to 10:30 AM. 
                        Also take note that all classes finishes 1:20 PM everyday. <br/>
                        This institution offers 3 semesters per year of student's study life. <br/>
                        Semester 1: September 8 - December 12. <br/>
                        Winter break: December 13 - December 27. <br/>
                        Semester 2: December 28 - March 24. <br/>
                        Spring break: March 25 - April 9. <br/>
                        Semester 3: April 10 - June 30. <br/>
                        Summer break: July 1 - September 7. <br/>
                        Public holiday is included within the study semester. <br/>
                        I wish the children their great success in the future. <br/>
